# SageMaker Endpoint Invocation Script

## Description
This script is designed to securely invoke an AWS SageMaker model endpoint. It sends a predefined JSON payload to the model and prints the model's response. This can be useful for testing model responses during development or for security assessments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Boto3 library
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate AWS credentials

## Setup
1. **Install Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Boto3**:
   Run the following command to install Boto3:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3
   ```

3. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   Set up your AWS credentials (AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key) and default region using the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

## Usage
1. **Modify the script**:
   - Update the `endpoint_name` variable in the script with the name of your SageMaker model endpoint.
   - Modify the `payload` variable to match the data structure expected by your model.

2. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script from your command line:
   ```bash
   python invoke_sagemaker_endpoint.py
   ```

## Security Notes
- Always validate and sanitize inputs to the script to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure your AWS credentials are stored securely and use IAM roles with the least privileges necessary.
- Regularly monitor your AWS access logs for any unauthorized access attempts.

This script is provided for educational and testing purposes. Always ensure your testing complies with legal and ethical standards, particularly when using real data.
